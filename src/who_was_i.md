# Who was I?
I was Samuel Mun. I was a Korean-American born in Busan in 1998. I grew up in Southern California, raised by Christian parents. I had a blessed and ordinary childhood. Growing up in the 2000s, I grew up at a time when technology was beginning to seep into every aspect of human life.

After finishing high school at Oxford Academy (a small public school), I continued my education at UC Berkeley. I had a great time at Berkeley where I really enjoyed the intense academic environment.

After graduating and working for a few years, I discovered the great tragedy of my life. In February 2023, I discovered that I had cancer. This cancer progressed, despite the great innovations of modern medicine. Now as I write this, my chance of long-term survival is 0~5%.

So who was I? I was a life-long scholar. I loved the field of chemistry and devoted a large part of my youth and adulthood to pursuing knowledge in the chemical sciences. I was a musician. While I wasn't very technically skilled, I took great pride and joy in singing and leading music for my church. I was a husband. I was exceedingly blessed to find love in my short life. I will always remember my wife Dorothy and the love we shared. I was a Christian. I believed that Jesus Christ was the infinite God who became a finite man. I believed that after His crucifixion and resurrection, He is now living in His believers in an intimate union. My religion colored my life and gave me great hope in my last days.

There are only so many words that I can type in my time left. And how can these few words convey who I was? So why am I writing this? These will be my last words. Maybe no one will ever read these words. But I take comfort knowing my last words are out there. Well, as long as GitHub and Vercel are willing to host my words for free. Long live the brave new age of technology.
