# Who was I?
I was Samuel Mun. I was a Korean-American born in Busan in 1998. I grew up in Southern California, raised by Christian parents. I had a blessed and ordinary childhood. Growing up in the 2000s, I grew up at a time when technology was beginning to seep into every aspect of human life.

After finishing high school at Oxford Academy (a small public school), I continued my education at UC Berkeley. I had a great time at Berkeley where I really enjoyed the intense academic environment.

After graduating and working for a few years, I discovered the great tragedy of my life. In February 2023, I discovered that I had cancer. This cancer progressed, despite the great innovations of modern medicine. Now as I write this, my chance of long-term survival is 0~5%.

So who was I? I was a life-long scholar. I loved the field of chemistry and devoted a large part of my youth and adulthood to pursuing knowledge in the chemical sciences. I was a musician. While I wasn't a particularly impressive musician, I take pride in my compositions.
